# LearnQuick

LearnQuick is a College Student 4 College Student application, to be used by high schoolers, college students, and young adults, but can be used by anyone!
Its main purpose is to be a tutoring service, but we offer open, free courseware for all your courses and topics. We avoid quizzes and tests, preferring actual activities and labs.

Based on Moodle!
Moodle is designed to allow educators, administrators and learners to create personalised learning environments with a single robust, secure and integrated system.

## Documentation

Everything is through our GitHub Wiki. Go to there first for your questions, they might have already been answered! ^w^

## Developers

- Make your own course, entirely from scratch. Use our libraries and API to design and implement an entirely customized course, and export it through our software (will be tested beforehand).
- Help maintain our software, from the libraries to the main application.
